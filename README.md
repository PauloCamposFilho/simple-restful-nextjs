This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

This is a simple app that makes requests to the RESTCountries API and displays the results on your screen. Still being iterated on. The purpose of this app was to familiarize myself with NextJS.

## To-do list:

- Change application flow
  - Add a "main" results window with just the most basic of information of the countries returned.
    - Small flag, name, region, population
  - Add possible filters so user can search not only by name
    - Region, Sub-region, Spoken Languages, Currency...
